## Description


The first screen will be a list of products, we need to show the product image and some other info that comes back from the API (product name, description, and price). When clicking on an element from the first screen we should move to the detail screen, where we will see a bigger image and bigger information and also the reviews we've for that product. On the detail screen, we need to allow the user to write reviews for that specific product and to trigger an API call to save that information in the system.
